This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```sh
npm i
```

### Local Development

To start a local development server, run the following command.

```sh
npm start
```

This command opens up a browser window and most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
