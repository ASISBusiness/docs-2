A new flag called `disable_total` has been added to the below endpoints. When set to `true`, the total count from the response will be omitted, and the endpoint's response time will be vastly improved.

This flag currently defaults to `false`, however, we strongly recommend to begin using this flag because in future the default will be set to `true`.
