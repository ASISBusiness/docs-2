We're excited to announce the launch of our Extended RPC Methods! These are powerful EVM RPC methods that make decoded, human-readable crypto data easily accessible through RPC-style calls ðŸš€

### Extended RPC Methods

- [`eth_getDecodedTransactions`](/rpc-nodes/reference/extended-rpc/eth_getDecodedTransactions): Get wallet history by wallet address
- [`eth_getTokenBalances`](/rpc-nodes/reference/extended-rpc/eth_getTokenBalances): Get ERC-20 token balances by wallet
- [`eth_getTokenPrice`](/rpc-nodes/reference/extended-rpc/eth_getTokenPrice): Get ERC-20 prices by token address
- [`eth_getTokenMetadata`](/rpc-nodes/reference/extended-rpc/eth_getTokenMetadata): Get ERC-20 metadata by token address
- [`eth_getNFTBalances`](/rpc-nodes/reference/extended-rpc/eth_getNFTBalances): Get NFTs by wallet address
