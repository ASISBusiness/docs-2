To put it simply, RPC nodes are nodes (servers) that access a blockchain network (for example Ethereum), which enable you to interact with the network without running your own node.

## Overview

Moralis runs Ethereum RPC endpoints, supported by several APIs like Ethereum JSON-RPC, Beacon, Trace, Debug, Otterscan, Token, NFT APIs, and more.

## Supported chains

import { EVMRpcChainData } from '@site/src/components/SupportedChains';
