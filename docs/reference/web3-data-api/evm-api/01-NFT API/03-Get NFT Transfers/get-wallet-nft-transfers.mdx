    <p>This API will index direct NFT Transfers.</p>
    <p>
      Note that this API won't index indirect NFT transfers (such as those that
      pass through a smart contract).
    </p>
    <p>
      The NFT transfer from the buyer to the seller through OpenSea
      Marketplace's smart contract is an example of an indirect transfer.
