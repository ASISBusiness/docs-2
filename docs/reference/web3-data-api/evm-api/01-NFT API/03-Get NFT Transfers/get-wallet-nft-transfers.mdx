# Get NFT transfers by wallet

:::info Non-Direct NFT Transfers

This API will only index direct NFT Transfers.

If the NFT transfer is indirect (passes through a smart contract, for example), then such transfers will _not_ be indexed by this API.

The NFT transfer from the buyer to the seller through OpenSea Marketplace's smart contract is an example of an indirect transfer.
