## Deleting a User Account

Users can not delete their accounts directly from the user interface. To delete an account, a user needs to contact [hello@moralis.io](mailto:hello@moralis.io). This can be done either by:

- The user
- An owner of an account

## Removing a User From a Team

As an owner or admin of a team account, you can remove users from a team if they have developer or maintainer roles. To do so, you will need to go to:

1. Your main menu (found in the bottom-left corner)
2. Click on "Account"
3. Click on "Team"
4. Select the user you wish to remove and click on "Actions" > "Remove" > "Confirm"
