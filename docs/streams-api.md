## What is the Streams API?

With Streams API you can listen for real time events on chain, you can listen for when a new event is emitted in your contract or for when a walltet address does an NFT transfer or a transaction. You can also get notifications for native and internal transactions.  You will receive webhook requests for those events specific to your stream configuration.

## Streams API features

- Get blockchain events streamed to your backend directly in real-time
- Listen to wallets or contract events, or both with multiple streams 
- Track one address or millions with just one stream, it is up to you 
- Fully customize your streams using filters, you want to only want to listen to transactions over 1000 USDT, no problem  
- Listen for events from all contract addresses
- Add your custom ABI and choose which events you want to listen too   
- and much more... 

## Popular use cases

- Realtime Wallet notifications (monitor when an address sends, receives, stakes, swaps, or burns assets)
- Monitor assets (get notifications when an asset is being sent, received, staked, swapped, or burned)
- In game specific events, for example when a battle starts in your web3 game
- Token sales (get notifications for when someone participates in your token sale)
- Any other smart contract event fires on-chain based on your filters

### Listen to all addresses use cases

- Listen to all NFT contract transfers [tutorial](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/listen-to-all-nft-contract-transfers)
- Listen to all events from new contracts specific to a contract factory [tutorial](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/listen-to-all-events-from-new-contracts-specific-to-a-contract-factory)
- Listen to all NFT contracts transfers where sender is a specific address [tutorial](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/listen-to-all-nft-contracts-transfers-where-sender-is-a-specific-address)
- Listen to all ERC20 contract transfers where sender is a specific address and number of coins transferred is over 1000 [tutorial](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/listen-to-all-erc20-contract-transfers-where-sender-is-a-specific-address-and-number-of-coins-transferred-is-over-1000)

## High reliability

- Moralis guarantees 100% delivery of webhooks
- If your service is down Moralis will retry to send the webhook in intervals
- If your service fails to receive the webhooks you can manually replay
