## What is an Token API?

An [Token API](https://moralis.io/api/token/) is a collection of APIs that can be used to index ERC20 token-related data, e.g. ERC20 token balance, ERC20 token metadata, from multiple [EVM chains](/web3-data-api/evm#supported-chains) that we support.

The [Token API](https://moralis.io/api/token/) is designed to provide high-quality, structured NFT data to developers to build application that interact with various ERC20 tokens.
