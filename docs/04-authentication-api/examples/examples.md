# Why use Web3 Authentication?

1. Starting a new project and need to log in users via their wallets?
2. Want to add Web3 authentication to an existing Web2 user database?
3. Would you like to use authentication aggregators such as Auth0 for your enterprise’s Web3 authentication flows?

If the answer to any of these questions is "yes", then the Moralis Web3 Auth API is just what you need!

# The Moralis Web3 Auth API

With the Moralis Web3 Auth API, you don't need to:

1. Redirect the user to third-party auth interfaces.
2. Understand Web3 authentication flows.
3. Learn how wallets sign or verify messages.
4. Master varying wallet standards.
5. Discover how wallets work on different blockchains.
6. Assume responsibility for the auth solution’s security.
7. Constantly update and maintain the auth solution.

# Full Control

You control everything.

All data is returned to your backend so you can fully store and handle it independently. All user profiles and identities are returned to you, and you do not depend on third-party providers for anything.

# How it Works

1. Your client requests a sign-in challenge.
2. Your server requests a challenge from the Moralis Auth API and passes it to the client.
3. The client then signs the message and passes it to your server for verification.
4. Your server verifies the challenge with Moralis.
