## What is the Auth API?

Auth API allows your user to authenticate and verify signed messages with their web3 wallets when using your dapp. Built accordingly to the [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) standard, enables your user to do off-chain authentication with their EVM or Solana-compatible wallets to establish user sessions with your dapp.

## Auth API Features

The Auth API provides out-of-the-box all the necessary APIs you need to authenticate your user wallet to your dapp, which includes:

- Requesting challenge message for wallet signature on both [EVM](/reference/requestchallengeevm) and [Solana](/reference/requestchallengesolana)
- Verifying signed challenge message signature on both [EVM](https://swagger.moralis.io/auth/#/Challenge/verifyChallengeEvm) and [Solana](https://swagger.moralis.io/auth/#/Challenge/verifyChallengeSolana)

> ðŸ“˜ The Auth API currently does not support [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signature. Therefore, authentication using the Auth API with smart contract wallet is impossible.
