## What is the Moralis SDK?

With the Moralis SDK, you can implement all of Moralis' products quickly and easily in your backend. The SDK comes with numerous features, such as:

- Easily query data from the EVM and Solana API (such as block info, transaction info, NFT metadata, token prices, user balances, owner list of an NFT, etc.)
- Web3 authentication, integrated into your own backend
- Several utilities to transform and format data

## What are the Languages Moralis Support?

We currently support the following languages for our SDKs:

- NodeJS
- C#
- Python

For other programming languages, you can call our API as you would for a normal REST API.
