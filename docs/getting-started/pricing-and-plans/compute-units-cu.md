All Moralis plans have generous limits on the number of requests you can make per month. How many included requests you have depends on the plan you have, check the [pricing page](https://moralis.io/pricing) for more details.

Some requests are more expensive than others. By giving some heavy requests higher weight, we ensure that you only pay for what you use and not a cent more. 

This allows you to get cheaper requests for most use cases while protecting our systems from abuse by weighing the computationally expensive endpoints.

## What is a Compute Unit (CU)?

A compute unit is a measure of the requests needed to query computationally expensive API endpoints. Each request weighs a certain amount of compute units.

See more [here](https://docs.moralis.io/reference/compute-units) for details about API endpoints that are weighted.
