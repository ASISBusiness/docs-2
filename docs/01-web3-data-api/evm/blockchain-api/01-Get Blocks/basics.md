In the rapidly evolving realm of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), data retrieval is the lifeblood of security, transparency, and control. Traditional approaches like Ethereum's [`eth_call`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v3.0.0-rc.5/web3-eth.html?highlight=eth.call#call) are giving way to innovative solutions like [Moralis](https://moralis.io/).

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the backbone of blockchain's decentralization promise, offering security, transparency, and control. These platforms rely heavily on efficient data retrieval systems for functions like wallet balance display and contract detail fetching. This article explores how Moralis revolutionizes DEX development and why it's a compelling choice over the traditional [eth_call](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call) method.

This article showcasing how Moralis simplifies and streamlines data retrieval and blockchain interactions for DEX developers.

## Traditional vs. Modern: A Quick Comparison

Historically, developers have used Ethereum's `eth_call` method to interact with contracts without modifying the blockchain state. Here's an example:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('YOUR_INFURA_ENDPOINT');

const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const data = 'YOUR_DATA';

web3.eth.call({
    to: contractAddress,
    data: data
}).then(console.log);
```

In contrast, Moralis introduces a revolutionary approach that streamlines data retrieval and blockchain interactions using the [getBlock](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-block) endpoint:

```javascript
const Moralis = require("moralis").default;
const { EvmChain } = require("@moralisweb3/common-evm-utils");

async function runApp() {
  await Moralis.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

  const blockNumberOrHash = "15863321";
  const chain = EvmChain.ETHEREUM;

  const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.block.getBlock({
    blockNumberOrHash,
    chain,
  });
  console.log(response.toJSON());
}

runApp();
```

## Why DEX Developers Should Choose Moralis

Seamless user experiences are the essence of DEXs, and the 'eth_call' function has been instrumental in laying the foundation. However, the current landscape demands tools that combine speed with efficiency. Moralis stands as a pioneer in this regard, ushering in the next era of DEX development with advanced features such as reduced coding lines, faster data retrieval, and enhanced security protocols.

This section provides insights into Moralis's capabilities, not only in integrating with renowned frameworks but also in spearheading successful global projects.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this article invites you to explore the world of Moralis and become a leader in the unfolding decentralized future. Armed with knowledge and supported by a community of like-minded developers, you can shape the future of DEXs with Moralis.
