# Transaction Labelling

The Moralis Transactions API automatically decodes raw transaction input data into human-readable events based on the functions and events defined within the associated contract ABI. 

This means that each transaction and log are labelled with a friendly, easily recognizable label, making it easier than ever to understand and navigate the complex world of blockchain.

Each transaction includes a `decoded_call` object which is the decoded `input` data of the transaction, whilst each log includes a `decoded_event` object which is the decoded `topic` data.

As an example.....Reuben to add an example.

## Which endpoints support Transaction labelling?

We have included support for transaction labelling on two new endpoints:

| Name                                        | Endpoint                                                       |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Get native transactions by wallet (verbose) | `/:address/verbose`                      |
| Get transaction by hash (verbose)           | `/transaction/:transaction_hash/verbose` |

## Why are some transactions not decoded?
We only decode transactions with ABIs from verified contracts. We are continuously adding to our repository of verified contract ABIs.

If transaction is related to an unverified contract, or it's part of a verified contract that do not yet support, transactions will have a `decoded_call` of `null` and logs will have a `decoded_event` of `null`.

We have plans to make ABI submissions available via the API in future, however until this time, if you would like an ABI to be supported please add your submissions to our [ABI requests board](https://roadmap.moralis.io/b/feature-requests/).

## What chains currently support transaction labelling?
All of our EVM blockchains support transaction labelling, with the highest contract coverage on Ethereum.

## Will you continue to add new contract ABIs?

Yes, absolutely! We plan to continue adding verified contract ABIs to our repository. We have plans to make this automatic in future, however until this time, if you would like an ABI to be supported please add your submissions to our [ABI requests board](https://roadmap.moralis.io/b/feature-requests/).

## What are some use cases of Transaction labelling?

Transaction labelling can be a powerful feature in a number of different use cases. Here are some popular ones:

- Displaying a clear timeline of events for a given wallet
- Identifying different types of transactions for specific use-cases, such as taxable events
- Building an intuitive block explorer
