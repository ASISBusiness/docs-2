## Roles and Permissions

Users can be invited to participate in different organizations in Moralis through the teams feature. A user can have different abilities depending on which role they have in a particular team. There are four main roles that a user can have. The roles are the following:

- **Developers** are direct contributors and have access to read/write in the test/dev environment.
- **Maintainers** are developers that are able to push to master and deploy to production. This role is often held by maintainers and engineering managers.
- **Admins** have access to most actions except adding or removing other admins or higher roles.
- **Owners** are group admins and they have access to any action and have destructive capabilities.
